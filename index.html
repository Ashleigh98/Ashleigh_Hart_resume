                    <p>I am 24 years old and currently expanding my knowledge of web development. I love to read, solve problems and learn more about anything that piques my interest in my free time. I thought coding was interesting and wanted to learn so I jumped right in and started to learn from free coding websites but now I am in a bootcamp because I am serious about wanting to learn and acquire the skills necessary to become a web developer.</p>
                    <p>I would like to be involved in frontend development and work with complex designs and structures but I am open to doing backend development as well.</p>
                    <p>What motivates me is the feeling of success after figuring out a problem. It is a great feeling knowing that I have accomplished something especially when working with code.</p>
